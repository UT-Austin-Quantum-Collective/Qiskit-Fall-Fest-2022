## Our Project
Our group decided to investigate Quantum Cryptography, and specifically Quantum Bit Commitment. We read a few papers and the Wikipedia sites in order to better understand the topic, and decided to try to implement a theoretical protocol we found. Through this search to understand the Quantum Bit commitment, we gained understanding in classical bit commitment as well as the history of Quantum Cryptography as a whole. Through constant frustration we also built our "Quantum Intuition" and began to be able to read through the super confusing notation and vocabulary.

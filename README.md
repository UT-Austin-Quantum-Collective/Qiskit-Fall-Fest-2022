# Welcome
This is the Qiskit Fall Fest for The University of Texas at Austin. We're so exciting to have you all here. This event is being hosted by the Quantum Collective at UT Austin. [If you don't know us yet, check us out here!](https://quantum-collective.webflow.io/) The [Qiskit Fall Fest](https://medium.com/qiskit/introducing-the-qiskit-fall-fest-feb8456b557) is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world. 

[Check out last year's event!](https://utqc.medium.com/ut-austin-qiskit-fall-fest-2021-aef227ef6c3b)

## This Year's Theme: Education

In our educationally themed hackathon, we ask participants to take on the challenge of learning a topic in quantum computing as part of our mission to make the entry barrier into quantum science accessible regardless of where you start. Before our kick-off ceremony, we spent a week hosting workshops to get students familiar with Qiskit and the fundamentals of Quantum Computing.


### Azure Quantum Challenge Eligibility

This Year, we are happy to announce an integrated challenge with our Qauntum Partners! Stay Tuned for more info 😉

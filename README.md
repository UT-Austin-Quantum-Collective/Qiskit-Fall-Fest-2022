Welcome
This is the Qiskit Fall Fest event for MYCAMPUS. We're so exciting to have you all here. This event is being hosted by the Awesome Quantum Club at MYCAMPUS, please consider joining our club. We meet every Tuesday in Room A112.

The Qiskit Fall Fest is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from the entire IBM Quantum team. Student leaders work alongside IBM throughout the month of September to design and plan their event, which are then run in October. The events vary from technical hackathons to beginner-friendly challenges, all with the goal of helping to grow the local communityâ€™s skill set.

The Fall Fest here on MYCAMPUS is going to be a hackathon, starting on October 22nd. Details about the hackathon and rules can be found below. The deadline for all projects is October 24th, at 1pm ET. Any projects submitted after that will NOT be judged. Good luck!

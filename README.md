This is the Qiskit Fall Fest for The University of Texas at Austin. We're so exciting to have you all here. This event is being hosted by the Quantum Collective at UT Austin. [If you don't know us yet, check us out here!](https://quantum-collective.webflow.io/) The [Qiskit Fall Fest](https://medium.com/qiskit/introducing-the-qiskit-fall-fest-feb8456b557) is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world. 

[Quantum sound intimidating? Check out last year's event, where over 50 quantum novices made amazing projects in just a weekend!](https://utqc.medium.com/ut-austin-qiskit-fall-fest-2021-aef227ef6c3b)

## This Year's Theme: Education

In our educationally themed hackathon, we ask participants to take on the challenge of learning a topic in quantum computing as part of our mission to make the entry barrier into quantum science accessible regardless of where you start. Before our kick-off ceremony, we spent a week hosting workshops to get students familiar with Qiskit and the fundamentals of Quantum Computing.


### Azure Quantum Add-On Challenge Eligibility

 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57876448/195365270-9fc3bc5e-a02d-4231-8c5a-7230648c0da1.png" alt="drawing" width="200"  hspace="20" vspace="20"/> 

This Year, we are happy to announce an integrated challenge with our Partner-- Azure Quantum! Qiskit projects can be run on **real quantum hardware** on Azure Quantum from IonQ, Rigetti, and Quantinuum for our Hack-a-thon. If you choose to use Azure Quantum for your Fall Fest project, then you are eligble for a seperate prize pool for our Azure Quantum Challenge. We will have workshops and office hours on Discord from the Microsoft team during the week leading up to the hack-a-thon.

### Nick Bronn, IBM Quantum
***10/18/22 3:00 PM CST, virtual***

**Title:** Outlook for Quantum Computing with Superconducting Qubits

https://utexas.zoom.us/j/96501812773

**Abstract:**

Quantum computers promise to solve certain problems that are intractable on any current or future classical computer. Recently, small-scale noisy quantum computing prototypes have been constructed, with those consisting of superconducting qubits a currently popular modality. In this talk, I'll give an overview of the history and physics of superconducting qubits, followed by IBM's hardware and software roadmaps for scaling these processors and their applications. As error mitigation is essential in the current era of noisy quantum hardware, I show how Qiskit Research facilitates the adoption of these research tools without the need for low-level knowledge of the underlying hardware and software.
